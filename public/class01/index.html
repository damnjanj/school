            <p>
                Named after the sixth planet from the Sun, the design of the various Saturn rockets evolved from the Jupiter vehicles.

        <p>
            The Saturn V is a retired American super heavy-lift launch vehicle developed by NASA
            under the Apollo program for human exploration of the Moon. The rocket was human-rated,
            had three stages, and was powered by liquid fuel. Flown from 1967 to 1973, it was used for
            nine crewed flights to the Moon, and to launch Skylab, the first American space station.
            As of 2024, the Saturn V remains the only launch vehicle to have carried humans beyond low Earth orbit (LEO).
            The Saturn V holds the record for the largest payload capacity to low Earth orbit, 311,152 lb (141,136 kg),
            which included unburned propellant needed to send the Apollo command and service module and
            Lunar Module to the Moon.

            <h2>APOLLO PROGRAM</h2>
            <div class="divider_lane"></div>
            <p>
                The Apollo program, also known as Project Apollo, was the United States human
                spaceflight program led by NASA, which successfully landed the first humans on
                the Moon in 1969.[2] Apollo followed Project Mercury that put the first Americans
                in space. It was conceived in 1960 as a three-person spacecraft during President
                Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration. Apollo was later dedicated to President
                John F. Kennedy's national goal for the 1960s of "landing a man on the Moon and
                returning him safely to the Earth" in an address to Congress on May 25, 1961.
                It was the third US human spaceflight program to fly, preceded by Project Gemini
                conceived in 1961 to extend spaceflight capability in support of Apollo.

            <p>
                Kennedy Space Center, one of 10 NASA field centers, is a premier multi-user spaceport with about 100
                private-sector partners and nearly 250 partnership agreements.
                The presence of commercial companies at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center is larger than ever before,
                enabling us to embark on a new era of space exploration. Although Kennedy is the agency’s main
                launch site, the center also is home to facilities that research and develop innovative solutions
                that government and commercial space ventures need for working and living on the surfaces of the
                Moon and other bodies in our solar system.
